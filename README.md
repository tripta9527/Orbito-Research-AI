# Orbito Research AI

## Introduction
Orbito Research AI is an independent project aimed at analyzing and fully solving the board game **Orbito**, developed by **FLEXIQ**. This AI is built using a **precomputed game tree solution**, where all possible board states and their results are stored in advance. The primary goal of this project is to provide an in-depth strategic analysis of the game and offer deterministic decision-making.

## Features
- **Fully precomputed game tree solution**
- **Instant decision-making with no real-time search required**
- **AI vs. Human, AI vs. AI gameplay simulation**
- **No machine learning, neural networks, or tree search involved**

## Installation and Usage
### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Orbito-Research-AI.git
cd Orbito-Research-AI
```

### 2. Open the HTML file
You can simply open the `index.html` file in a browser:
```sh
